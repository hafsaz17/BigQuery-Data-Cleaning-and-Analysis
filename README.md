# BigQuery-Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis

This repository contains SQL files for cleaning and analyzing various datasets using BigQuery. The data used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and other public open-source datasets.

## Cleaning Process

The datasets were cleaned using the following processes:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were addressed using appropriate techniques.
2. **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate records were identified and removed from the datasets.
3. **Checking Word Length**: Analysis of word lengths was performed to ensure data consistency.
4. **Extracting Substrings**: Substrings were extracted from text fields as required for analysis.
5. **Trimming Whitespace**: Leading and trailing whitespace in text fields were trimmed for uniformity.
6. **Converting Data Types**: Data types were converted as needed for analysis.
7. **Concatenating**: Data was concatenated where necessary to combine relevant information.

## Analysis Methods

The analysis was conducted using various SQL techniques including:

- **Joins**: Different datasets were joined using appropriate keys.
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: CTEs were utilized for improved readability and performance.
- **Temporary Tables**: Temporary tables were created for intermediate analysis steps.
- **Window Functions**: Window functions were used to perform calculations across rows.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc., were used for summarization.
- **Creating Views**: Views were created to encapsulate complex queries for reuse.
- **Converting Data Types**: Data types were converted as necessary for analysis.

## Usage

To use the SQL files in this repository, you'll need access to BigQuery. Simply load the datasets in your BigQuery environment and run the SQL files to replicate the cleaning and analysis processes outlined here.
